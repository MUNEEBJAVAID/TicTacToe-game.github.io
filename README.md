# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project provides a basic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game. Players take turns to place their 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid, and the game ends when a player wins by having three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when the board is full, resulting in a tie.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click on any cell to place your 'X' or 'O'.
3. The game will notify you when a player wins or if it's a tie.
4. Reload the page to start a new game.
